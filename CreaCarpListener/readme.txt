Hello!
This is a python graphic program that I developed for my daily work at my university's internship administration.
It creates folders from pdfs moved to the selected system path to the selected aim directory.
It sets the name of the folder to the one requested in my job, and does the same with the PDF, that gets moved to its respective folder.
You can see more info in the GUI.
